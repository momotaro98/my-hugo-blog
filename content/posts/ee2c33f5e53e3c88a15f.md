## Introduction

In this article I will share Golang checker tool I created. The tool checks import paths are sorted "strictly". 

Here's the tool repository link.

https://github.com/momotaro98/strictimportsort

## The issue

goimports supports `-local` flag when we have local path.

When we have such an import paths.

```go
import (
    "errors"
    "github.com/google/wire"
    "github.com/momotaro98/mixlunch-service-api/partyservice"
)
```

Then run goimports with `-local` flag

```
$ goimports -local "github.com/momotaro98" .
```

The files are sorted with whilte line like following.

```go
import (
    "errors"

    "github.com/google/wire"
    
    "github.com/momotaro98/mixlunch-service-api/partyservice"
)
```

However, when we have a go file whose import paths are separate with white line in advance, `goimports` doesn't support sorting for the file.

```go
import (
    "errors"

    "github.com/momotaro98/mixlunch-service-api/partyservice"

    "github.com/google/wire"
)
```

When I use GoLand IDE, it sometimes makes white line separate import paths like above.

I expected "github.com/momotaro98" is at last but goimports regards it's fine since it already has a white line.

## Tool I made

[strictimportsort](https://github.com/momotaro98/strictimportsort) is a checker tool you can check go files whose import paths are not sorted "strictly".

```
$ strictimportsort -exclude "*_mock.go,*.pb.go" -exclude-dir "testmock" -local "github.com/momotaro98" .
```

Command line tool supports `-exclude`, `-exclude-dir` flag and `-local` flag as well as goimports.

We can see instruction output when there's such "not sorted strictly" files with file names, line number, and column number like followings.

```
/Users/shintaro/.ghq/github.com/momotaro98/mixlunch-service-api/partyservice/domain_test.go:8:2: import not sorted correctly. should be replace to
import (
        "errors"
        "testing"
        "time"

        "github.com/golang/mock/gomock"

        "github.com/momotaro98/mixlunch-service-api/userservice"
        "github.com/momotaro98/mixlunch-service-api/utils"
)
/Users/shintaro/.ghq/github.com/momotaro98/mixlunch-service-api/userservice/provider.go:5:2: import not sorted correctly. should be replace to
import (
        "github.com/google/wire"

        "github.com/momotaro98/mixlunch-service-api/tagservice"
)
```

## You can modify the target files with `-w` option.

We can modify the target files by using `-w` option.

```
$ strictimportsort -w -exclude "*_mock.go,*.pb.go" -exclude-dir "testmock" -local "github.com/momotaro98" .
```

Just adding the `-w` option, strictimportsort modifies the target files and doesn't show the results.
